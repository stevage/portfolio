This is a prototype of a designed to allow sports planners to better understand the current locations of sports facilities in relation to local populations. In addition to classic filtering and search features, a couple of features are somewhat unique:

* A "nearest alternative facilitiess" layer highlights other nearby facilities of the same type, drawing a distance-marked arrow to them.
* The number of people living within 400m walk or 20m drive can be requested, accessed from a third-party service.
* Statistics on the number of facilities and facilities per capita for each local government area, and comparison to the state average.

My role was to lead the mapping component, mentor other team members on GIS basics, manage the back-end data processing, and share in the web development work in a quick development timeframe.

I built this interactive map of wine regions, using data supplied by vW Maps. Some features:

- A pre-computed index of region names, combined into the Mapbox GL Geocoder for searching.
- Label locations pre-computed using centroids of polygons.
- Two different map styles displayed using Mapbox-GL-Compare.
- Three different boundary types (regions at different scales), managed together.
- Modal about box.
- Mobile-friendly design.

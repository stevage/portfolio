This was partially a rebuild of an existing site, to improve the aesthetics and usability of the site. It allows the user to visualise public health data related to dentistry across Germany. I wrote all the code, but was able to reuse some of the code to load the different datasets.

Features:
- select from a few dozen different variables
- choose municipal or regional level boundaries
- choose the year of data
- displays choropleths of the selected variables using [mapbox-choropleth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mapbox-choropleth), a library I created.
- click a region to see a graph of that variable over time, using chart.js

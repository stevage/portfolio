**Ziggurat Calculator** is a proof of concept of a tool for property developers, commissioned by FrontierSI. Users can draw a precinct on the map to select a number of adjoining properties. The maximum developable floor area is then computed and visualised, by applying a series of council-defined setbacks. Then, the maximum floor area that could be achieved by joining the properties together is computed and overlaid.

The property dataset is loaded as a static Geobuf file, less than 4MB for all the property boundaries in the City of Maroondah area. I use Turf to apply the setbacks and compute the total area, and Mapbox-GL-JS for the data visualisation.

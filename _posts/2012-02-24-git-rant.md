After a frustrating few weeks using Git professionally for the first time, I tried to pinpoint the source of my difficulties through a ranty listicle. 

Some points missed the mark, some nailed it. A few months later, it somehow caught fire and reached the front page of Reddit and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4340047). In the years since it was published:

* Thousands of comments have been posted, on the blog post itself, and on several social media sites. It still receives around a comment a week.
* It's been cited in [an academic paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2983990.2984018) which led to an improved command line interface, [Gitless](http://gitless.com/).
* It's cited as a motivation in Alan Hohn's book *[Conversational Git](http://blog.anvard.org/conversational-git/chapter-01.html)*, chapter 1.
* My overblown hyperbolic statement "Git doesnâ€™t so much have a leaky abstraction as **no** abstraction. There is essentially no distinction between implementation detail and user interface." is the inspirational quote for the alternative version control system, "[Lead](https://github.com/lead-scm/pb)".

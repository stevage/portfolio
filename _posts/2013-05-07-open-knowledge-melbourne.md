description: How to summarise Open Knowledge Melbourne? An evolving journey of community building, open-everything technical-exploration and a "why not" attitude. We formed the group in April 2013 after a "<a href="https://au.okfn.org/2013/04/12/data-hack-map/">Data Hack</a>" course at The Age in which we taught participants to make maps using modern cartography tools. Maia Sauren, Fiona Tweedie, Craig Butt and I were the initial "Open Knowledge ambassadors", with David Flanders instigating the group. Over the years, we ran <a href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Open-Knowledge-Melbourne/events/past">nearly 150 events</a>, from epic hackathons such as GovHack and HealthHack and high-profile speakers, to big social meetups and "shut up and hack nights" where anyone from government, academia, the private sector or elsewhere could cross paths and work on improving knowledge flow.

**Find My School** is a high-profile website I built for Victoria's Department of Education, allowing parents for the first time to directly find out which school zones their address lies within. It uses a custom NodeJS service to provide a boundary lookup API, which uses vector tiles as a kind of spatial index.

(Visual styling, accessibility, and system hosting were provided by others.)

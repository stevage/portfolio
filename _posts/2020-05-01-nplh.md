I was part of a small team building a trip planning site for tourists visiting Lüneburg Heath in northern Germany. The site uses Wegue, which is an OpenLayers framework based on VueJS, which we were also extending.

My major contributions included:

* A full navigation UI, including different modes, time and date for public transport, intermediate waypoints, and mapping the chosen route, using the HERE API.
* Integrating search (for specific client-provided landmarks, geocoded places, or a custom point) with the routing workflow.
* Internationalising the whole interface, to support both English and German.
* A "save to PDF" feature, allowing the map to be saved for offline use.
* A "download as GPX" feature, allowing either the current navigation plan, or all map layers, to be downloaded for use in mapping applications.
* Dynamically generating marker pins using SVG, according to user-defined properties such as colour and icon.

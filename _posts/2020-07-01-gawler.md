The Gawler Challenge is a hackathon run by Unearthed where teams compete to make the best predictions of where minerals might be found, given some supplied data. My challenge was to take all of their submissions (more than 50 teams), which had no imposed data standards (not even formats!) and somehow turn them into a single interactive data visualisation.

Data issues included:
- Directories that ranged from a single CSV file (in one case, a single data point!) to complex directory trees with hundreds of files.
- Data in the form of points, polygons or even raster.
- Confusing mixed terminology around elements, chemical symbols, mineral names, commodities.
- Metadata that followed no standard, and was often undocumented. Is a confidence of 8.2 good or bad?

Other challenges included:
- Designing a colour scheme which was somewhat intuitive, and could also distinguish a dozen or so different elements.
- Processing and displaying raster imagery alongside vector.
- Customising the basemap for just the right level of detail and colour.
- Designing an interface to let users sift through all the data and toggle the right layers on and off.

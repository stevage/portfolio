This is a simple site that displays the locations of local branches of the Good Karma Effect. The data is managed in a Google Sheet, which is a nice, simple way of allowing the data custodian to make regular updates without requiring my intervention each time.

There is a little bit of custom logic so the user can enter an address, which is geocoded, and then the closest location is highlighted and zoomed to.

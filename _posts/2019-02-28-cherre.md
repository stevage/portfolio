**Cherre** is a New York-based startup providing a sophisticated real estate data platform. I helped architect and a build a new version of their property search map, a huge improvement of the previous version which only supported displaying a single pin at once. 

Features of the new search tool:

* Filter by hundreds of attributes
* Display up to 1000 pins on the map at once
* Display lot boundaries and/or 3D buildings
* Toggle overlays including subways, school zones, business improvement districts and opportunity zones.
* Map smoothly adjusts to context, fading in and out layers as appropriate.
* Uses GraphQL to efficiently fetch data from the backend, joining it with geometry obtained as vector tiles.

(Most of the React heavy lifting was done by others.)

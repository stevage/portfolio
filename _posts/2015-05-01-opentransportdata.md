description: PTV's timetable API was released with poorly formatted, borderline unusable documentation in Word format. I turned it into an easy to browse website using Swagger. I also implemented the rather complex API signature generation step directly into the site, lowering the barrier to entry for developers wanting to try out the API.

    The portal is still online (but now out of date) at opentransportdata.org. For a time, PTV were using a version of this code as their official documentation, but (as of November 2017), <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/about-ptv/ptv-data-and-reports/digital-products/ptv-timetable-api/ptv-timetable-api-reference/">no longer</a>.

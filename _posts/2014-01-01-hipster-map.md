The joke that went too far, this silly idea was cooked up by good friend Maia Sauren, who thought it would be a good community-building exercise for Open Knowledge Melbourne. She led the team of snark content creators, someone else did the original design and I put it together. I've since rebuilt most of it several times, to provide it with a suitably hipster cartography.

The [article on page 3 of *The Age*](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/mapping-the-hip-haunts-of-the-fashionably-uncool-20140406-366tz.html) gave it far more credit than it deserved, not to mention [this ABC Radio Melbourne piece](http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2014/03/19/3962737.htm?site=melbourne). It still gets quite a lot of traffic. Perhaps due to the accidental hipster SEO text.

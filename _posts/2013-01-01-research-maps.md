description: Over the course of several years I taught around 20 mapping workshops, creating and refining material using a very hands-on methodology of "try to replicate this output". To support the workshops I spun up a number of server instances, encouraging participants to work together as a table, one per server. <br><br>The content is available at <a href="http://researchmaps.net">researchmaps.net</a>.
